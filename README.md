## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Although this is a project that mainly we can develop in HTML and CSS, I developed it in React as an unique component and CSS for the styles. The most important part was undertand the media query to adapt both versions, mobile and desktop.

### Continued development

I would like to continue developing this challenges using React as main resource and complementing with other ones as HTML5, CSS, SAAS, among others
